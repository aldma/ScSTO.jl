# ScSTO.jl
Sparse and Constrained Switching Time Optimization

ScSTO is a modeling tool for switching time optimization (STO) problems in [Julia](https://julialang.org/).
ScSTO builds upon [SwitchTimeOpt.jl](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/SwitchTimeOpt.jl) and extends it, in that switching costs and constraints on the switching times can be easily incorporated.
